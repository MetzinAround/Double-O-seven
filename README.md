Teamwork Collaboration Fun Time: 007

This will take longer, and will be more involved, and will use a little bit of code. You’ll be working together collaboratively. Using all you’ve learned today, work in a group of 3-5 people to accomplish the following task. This can be done in the language of your choice. 

1. Write a function named introduction() that has two parameters named first_name and last_name.
1. The function should return the last_name, followed by a comma, a space, first_name another space, and finally last_name.

I’ve created a repo for you to fork and work in. One person from the group should fork the repo and make sure it’s public, then invite others to join the repo to work together. 
Once you’re in the forked repo (the one you now own) you can begin following these instructions. 

1. Open the web editor (press period on the keyboard). 
1. Create a new directory in the repo using the new folder button.
1. Name the directory [firstName1, firstName2, firstName3] with the group members’ names. 
1. Inside the directory, make a file for whatever language your group wants to write in. 
1. Using an issue, create tasks for the members to accomplish (this part is entirely up to you as you write the code. How will you accomplish the coding task? Work together to come up with the solution, then work together to decide on tasks for each person.)
1. The repo should have, by the end of the project:
    1. More than one branch 
    1. Multiple Commit
    1. At least one internal Pull Request
1. Once the main branch of your fork contains a working answer to the prompt, you can create a PR back to the fork, and everyone’s folders will be added in the original repo!
